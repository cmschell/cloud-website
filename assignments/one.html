    <p>My name is Christina Schell and joined the Army ten days after graduating high school in 2000. I was an electronic signals specialist and served in Germany, Washington DC, Arizona and Denver. I separated from active duty in 2004 and earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems from Columbia College in 2008. I then moved to San Diego and worked in sales for three years until the economy recovered from the housing crisis. During this time I developed a hobby of creating WordPress sites and fixing network and computer issues for friends and family. I loved computers and the little coding experience I had with WordPress ignited a strong desire to code.</p>

    <p>I started working with websites in 2013 as a front end web developer at Bridgepoint Education. My primary focus there was to customize the company's several microsites built in WordPress as well as maintain and update JavaScript on their primary site, www.ashford.edu. While working at Bridgepoint, I also commissioned into the Army Reserves as a Second Lieutenant to strengthen my leadership skills. I worked at the company for about 10 months before being deployed for a short time in October 2014. Upon my return in February 2015, I started working at Tealium.</p> 

    <p>Tealium is a Software as a Service (SaaS) company that provides Tag Management and cloud based data collection and storage. I started working as a Product Support Engineer level two where I worked with their main product, Tealium IQ. Over the past two years I have become the Senior Mobile Solutions Engineer and am the primary point of contact for all support related to Tealium's mobile Software Development Kit, which offers a cloud based delivery solution. I assist clients with implementing the SDK for iOS, Android and Windows platforms along with customizing their tag management solution to fit their digital strategy and data collection needs.</p>

    <p>I separated from the military in August 2014 after 4 years active duty and 3 years in the Reserves as an officer. I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and Software Engineering at National University with a projected graduation date of June 2017. I have an interest in Apple's new programming language for iOS (Swift) and full-stack web development. Either of these two fields would quench my thirst for coding.</p>
